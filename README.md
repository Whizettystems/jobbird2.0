<p>Welcome to jobBird! 
<p>This project started as a final team project at Fullstack Academy, a coding bootcamp in Chicago, Illinois. It was imagined as an app to help job seekers find open positions and organize their job search. Here is video about how we built it and how it works. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEfZEib1sbs&list=PLx0iOsdUOUmnbnnwuUalNmjYp3Ol5CsiA">here</a>! 
<p> Shortly after completing the bootcamp, I decided to continue the project and develop additional features. It is currently not deployed but being the code base is being updated daily and will hopefully be deployed soon! Enjoy.
